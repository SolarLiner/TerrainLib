    corrasion, saltation, and scouring (downcutting). Hydraulic action is distinguished from other types of water
    facilitated erosion, such as static erosion where water leaches salts and floats off organic material from
    unconsolidated sediments, and from chemical erosion more often called chemical weathering. It is a mechanical
    process, in which the moving water current flows against the banks and bed of a river, thereby removing rock
