    facilitated erosion, such as static erosion where water leaches salts and floats off organic material from
    unconsolidated sediments, and from chemical erosion more often called chemical weathering. It is a mechanical
    process, in which the moving water current flows against the banks and bed of a river, thereby removing rock
