    """The diamond-square algorithm is a method for generating heightmaps for computer graphics. It is a slightly better
    algorithm than the three-dimensional implementation of the midpoint displacement algorithm which produces 
    two-dimensional landscapes. It is also known as the random midpoint displacement fractal, the cloud fractal or the 
    plasma fractal, because of the plasma effect produced when applied.

    The idea was first introduced by Fournier, Fussell and Carpenter at SIGGRAPH 1982.

    The diamond-square algorithm starts with a 2D grid then randomly generates terrain height from four seed values
    arranged in a grid of points so that the entire plane is covered in squares.
