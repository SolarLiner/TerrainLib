TerrainLib is a library of algorithms used for landscape generation. They include generation, filtering and export
functions to allow to do everything with only one dependency: this library.

TerrainLib aims to be useful at both other projects wanting to include terrain generation, and end-user that don't mind
using scripting as a mean to generate landscape. The API is easy to use by striping away the complicated stuff while
staying customizable.

In a few lines you'll be able to create realistic looking terrain of any size.
